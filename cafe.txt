You enter the cafe to the sound of Hank Williams blaring on the juke box. 
A pretty dark haired waitress who seems to have been run off her feet all day smiles at you and hands you a menu.

@waitress You can sit wherever you like sir.
* A booth by the window [sitInbooth]
    You sit down in the empty booth.
    You drum your fingers on the formica table and watch the cars speed by on the interstate.
    * Keep looking out the window
        You see a man on a motorcyle. You decide to stop looking.
    * Go to the Bathroom
        The bathroom is old and cheap. You leave.
    >choice
* Back in the corner so you can see the whole resteraunt. [sitAtTable]
    Safety is important. Even for demons.

This day feels endless.
You're here for a meeting with the maggot.
You and your crew call him that but the name he goes by isn't much better.

The waitress arrives at your Table. Her name tag says Mindy.

@waitress Ready to order?
* Not just yet [waitToOrder]
    @winter Not yet. I'm waiting for someone, unfortunately.
* Coffee ASAP [orderCoffee]
    @winter Coffee, black. And I'm going need another hundred or so packs of sugar.

The waitress smirks.
@waitress Ok, back in a bit then.


And now the inevitable. You down have to look up. 
You hear the shuffling of feet and a shadow falls across your table.

@snitch Hello, Winter.

And the smell. Why does he always smell like that?

You look up and he's standing in front of you. Tall and too skinny to be real.
Bald too, gaunt with dark eyes and yellow teeth.
He looks like a human who's been turned but he's not. 
He's a third level ass kisser here on official business and from his smug face you're sure he wants you to know that too.

@winter Hello, Snitch.





@snitch So how have you been?

* Nearly dead. 
    @winter I'm ready to stab myself in the brain with an icepick, Snitch.
    @snitch It wouldn't kill you I'm afraid.
    @snitch The pain would be glorious though, wouldn't it.
    
* Not doing well. 
    @winter
    
>choice 

Snitch sneers at you. 

@winter You know we've been working solid for three months. 
@winter We don't sleep.
@winter We don't sleep, Snitch. We're just out here churning away.
@snitch Excuses are easy Winter.
* @winter Not excuses. Reality.
    @snitch Oh, is that what you call it now. I thought laziness was more applicable.
